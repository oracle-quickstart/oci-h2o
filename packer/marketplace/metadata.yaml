name: Driverless AI
longDescription: "<p>H2O's Driverless AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform\
  \ that automates some of the most difficult data science and machine learning workflows\
  \ such as feature engineering, model validation, model tuning, model selection,\
  \ and model deployment. It aims to achieve highest predictive accuracy, comparable\
  \ to expert data scientists, but in much shorter time thanks to end-to-end automation.\
  \ Driverless AI (DAI) also offers automatic visualizations and machine learning\
  \ interpretability (MLI). Especially in regulated industries, model transparency\
  \ and explanation are just as important as predictive performance.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>\
